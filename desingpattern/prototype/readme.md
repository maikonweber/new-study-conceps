# Prototype Pattern
- Prototype Desing Pattern is classified as creational 
desing pattern and allows us create new object bases on
a pre-existe object

## USE CASES
    - Creating new objects with similar properties
        * if need create objects that share similiar propeties, opting for prototype pattern to reduce 
        the overhead is the best decision
    - Optimizing object creation
        * if creation new object in the application costly decision opting for prototype pattern to
        reduce overhade s the best decision
    - Caching
        * if the developer needs to cache data ins application can opt for the prototype pattern
        to create cache of objects that are initialized 
        with default values.
        What a new object is needed, develepoer can cone one objects in the cache and modify its properties as needed
